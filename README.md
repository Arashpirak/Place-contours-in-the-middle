Image Contour Processing
This repository contains a Python script for processing images to find and draw contours. The script processes images from a specified directory, identifies contours, and saves two versions of each image: one with contours drawn and one without contours, both centered on a black background. This project was created as an initial version for a class assignment and may require further improvements.

Features

Identifies external contours in images

Draws contours and bounding rectangles on images

Saves processed images centered on a black background

Supports various image formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, GIF

Requirements

Python 3.x

OpenCV

Usage

Set the image_path variable to the directory containing your images.

Run the script to process the images and save the results in the specified output directory.
